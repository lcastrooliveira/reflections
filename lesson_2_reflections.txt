What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a hidden folder under the repository's root folder. It's needed
because it informs this folder is a reposisotory. It also starts tracking any
repository changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It's an intermediate place that it is used in order to build up logical commits.
It helps a better organization of commits by grouping all files in a logical meaning before
the commit is done.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can use the staging area to group the chages together across multiple files. Once
it has been done, then you can perform a logic change commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

It helps by giving you a chance to test a new feature/technique you're not sure it will work/ or wanna test, but
you still want to keep the original version untouched.
