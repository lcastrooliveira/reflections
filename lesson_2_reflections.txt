What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates a hidden folder under the repository's root folder. It's needed
because it informs this folder is a reposisotory. It also starts tracking any
repository changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It's an intermediate place that it is used in order to build up logical commits.
It helps a better organization of commits by grouping all files in a logical meaning before
the commit is done.
