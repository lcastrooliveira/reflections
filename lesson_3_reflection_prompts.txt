When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I'm working from another computer, or when I'm a contributor for someone's repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because maybe I don't want the remote changes just yet. Maybe I'm working on a feature and I don't want that external changes in the code
interfere on what I'm doing.
